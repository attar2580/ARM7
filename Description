LPG Gas Leak Detection and Safety Measures using ARM7 (LPC2148)

Project Overview :
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is commonly used in households, commercial kitchens, and industrial environments because of its efficiency and ease of use. Despite these advantages, LPG is highly flammable, and accidental gas leakage can lead to serious hazards such as fire, explosions, and health risks.
This project focuses on the design and implementation of an ARM7-based LPG Gas Leak Detection and Safety System using the LPC2148 microcontroller. The system continuously monitors LPG concentration in the surrounding environment and automatically takes safety measures when a gas leak is detected. The objective is not only to detect gas leakage but also to minimize risk by triggering immediate preventive actions.

Aim of the Project :
The main objectives of this project are:
To continuously monitor LPG gas concentration
To detect gas leakage at an early stage
To automatically activate safety mechanisms without human intervention
To improve safety in residential and industrial environments

System Features :
Real-time LPG gas detection using MQ-2 sensor
Fast response to gas leakage conditions
Automatic electrical power cutoff
Automatic gas valve control
Gas dispersion using exhaust fan
Reliable operation using ARM7 LPC2148 microcontroller

Hardware and Software Used :-

Hardware Components :
LPC2148 ARM7 Microcontroller
MQ-2 Gas Sensor
Relay Module
Servo Motor
Exhaust Fan
LCD Display
Buzzer
Power supply and supporting components

Software Tools :
Embedded C programming language
Keil µVision IDE
Flash Magic for program uploading

Working Principle:
The MQ-2 gas sensor continuously senses the surrounding air and produces an analog output corresponding to the concentration of LPG present. This analog signal is fed to the ADC of the LPC2148 microcontroller.
When the gas concentration is within safe limits, the system remains in normal monitoring mode. If the gas level exceeds the predefined threshold, the microcontroller immediately initiates safety actions. These actions include cutting off the electrical supply using a relay to avoid ignition, closing the gas valve using a servo motor, and activating an exhaust fan to disperse the accumulated gas. Alerts are also provided through a buzzer and LCD display.
This approach ensures quick response and reduces the chances of accidents caused by gas leakage.

Testing and Results :
The system was tested under controlled gas exposure conditions. The MQ-2 sensor was able to detect LPG concentrations in the range of 300 ppm to 10,000 ppm. Gas leakage was detected within 10 to 15 seconds, and all safety mechanisms were activated successfully. The relay response time was fast enough to ensure immediate power cutoff, and the servo motor operated accurately to control the gas valve.
The system demonstrated stable operation under different environmental conditions, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Applications:
Domestic kitchens
Restaurants and commercial kitchens
LPG storage areas
Industrial environments
Hotels and hostels

Advantages of the System :
Early detection of LPG leakage
